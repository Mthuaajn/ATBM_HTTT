- **GUI**: This folder contains the graphical user interface (WinForms) project. It typically includes forms, controls, and other UI-related components.
  
- **BUS**: Business logic layer where the application's business rules and logic are implemented. This layer acts as an intermediary between the GUI and DAO layers.

- **DTO**: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) are used for transferring data between different layers of the application. They represent the data that is exchanged between the GUI, BUS, and DAO layers.

- **DAO**: Data Access Objects (DAOs) encapsulate the logic required to access and manipulate data from the database. They provide methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### sql Folder

- **sql**: This folder contains SQL scripts used for setting up and maintaining the database. It includes schema creation scripts, table definitions, stored procedures, and other database-related scripts.

### Notes

- Ensure to maintain the separation of concerns between the GUI, BUS, DTO, and DAO layers to adhere to the principles of layered architecture.
